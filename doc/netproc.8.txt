NAME
  netproc - process-based network monitoring tool
SYNOPSIS
  netproc [-B] [-c] [-f [filename]] [-h] [-i iface] [-n] [-p udp | tcp] [-v]
          [--si]
DESCRIPTION
  netproc monitors network traffic and tries to find out which process
  this traffic belongs to, this is useful to quickly know who is consuming
  our network resources.

  netproc currently supports the TCP and UDP protocols over the IPv4 protocol.

OPTIONS
  -B, --bytes             view in bytes, default in bits.
  -c                      visualization each active connection of the process.
  -f, --file "filename"       save statistics in filename, filename is optional,
                          default is 'netproc.log', the data stored here are not erased,
                          even if the monitored program is closed, if there are two or more instances
                          of the same program and with the same arguments, the network statistics of
                          both are added and inserted in a single line and not a line for each process.
  -h, --help              show this message.
  -i, --interface iface   specifies an interface, default is all
                          except interface with network 127.0.0.0/8.
  -n                      numeric host and service, implicit '-c', try '-nh' to no
                          translate only host or '-np' to not translate only service.
  -p, --protocol tcp | udp  specifies a protocol, the default is tcp and udp.
  -v, --verbose           verbose mode, displays processes that have a connection listed in
                          /proc/net/[tcp | udp] but has no traffic.
  --si                    show SI format, with powers of 1000 (Kb, Mb,...), default is IEC,
                        with powers of 1024 (Kib, Mib,...).
  -V, --version           show version.

RUNNING CONTROL

  arrow keys    scroll
  s             change column-based sort
  q             exit

EXAMPLES
  This command will display the ips / ports of the udp traffic of the processes,
  monitoring all available interfaces, except the loopback, and log a summary
  in the file "log.txt":

    # netproc -p udp -c -f "log.txt"

  Useful to monitor the file generated in the above command:

    $ watch -t -d 'cat log.txt'

  Running whitout root:

    $ sudo setcap "cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+pe" /usr/local/sbin/netproc
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
